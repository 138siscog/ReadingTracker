## This the first large project i am working on, this is going to be a reading tracket you will be able to type in the books you are reading the page count, select start and end date you will be able to see stats of how many days you read or how many books you have read in a year / month ect Still in super early stages. 

## I am learnign how to use Customer tkinter to build this app and will implement SQL for database use and matplot lib to plot out stats

## Currently this is just a window with 4 buttons that do nothing, when you click the buttons the terminal will show what button you pressed and that is it, i am hoping to update this project on a regular basis

## Librarys used so far CustomerTkinter

from tkinter import *
import customtkinter as ctk

## Icon Logo was added

## This is the very first post for this project so its bare minimum as i am trying to learn CustomTkinter as i go.
